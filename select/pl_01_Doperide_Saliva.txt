Take you away for my magic ship
I have two hundred diesel horses thundering loud
Sea birds call your name and the mountain's on
fire
As the summer lightning cuts the sky like a hot
wire
And you ride on the swell and your heart is
alive
Think, I'll make you my seal driver
I'm no great looker, I'm no fast shakes
I'll give you a steady push on a six knot
simmerin' high tide
I can hold us down, keep our head to the wind
Or let us roll on the broadside, cold spray
flying in
And we'll ride on the swell and our hearts are
alive
Let me make you my seal driver
I could captain you, if you'd crew for me
Follow white flecked spin drift, float on a moon
kissed sea
Could you fancy me as a pirate bold?
Or a long ship viking warrior with the old gods
on his side?
Well, I'm an inshore man and I'm nobody's hero
But I'll make you tight for a windy night and a
dark ride
Let me take you in hand and bring you alive
Going to make you my seal driver, seal driver
